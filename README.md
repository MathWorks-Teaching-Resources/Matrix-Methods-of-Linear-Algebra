**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2020b. Compatible with R2020b and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental matrix methods commonly taught in introductory linear algebra courses. In the first part of each live script, students learn standard definitions, visualize concepts, and perform exercises on paper. Afterward, students practice complementary MATLAB® methods. These methods reinforce the discussed concepts and help students to develop an early familiarity with computational software. Each lesson concludes with an illustrative application.

## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module covers topics such as matrix operations, linear systems, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and diagonalization. It also includes examples of using matrix methods to modify grayscale images, analyze linear circuits, understanding vibrations, and Markov chains.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/image_0.png" width="19" alt="image_0.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/image_1.png" width="136" alt="image_1.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Matrix-Methods-of-Linear-Algebra&project=MatrixMethods.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on [MatrixMethods.prj](MatrixMethods.prj). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add-On Explorer. To install an add-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/image_2.png" width="16" alt="image_2.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**.
